# GIMP-Scripts

This is a repository for useful GIMP scripts for photographers.

With the lockdown of registry.gimp.org, there is no live script repository (until I figure out what to do with the registry). For the time being, we can use this to share and work on helpful photography-related scripts.

* __sg-luminosity-masks__
This is [Saul Goodes][goode] original script based on work that [Pat David][david-lum] had originally done porting [Tony Kuypers Luminosity Masks][kuyper-lum] to GIMP.
